# Python Exercises  

This repository is dedicated to collecting and practicing **Python programming exercises** of different levels and topics. The main goal is to reinforce concepts, improve problem-solving skills, and build a solid foundation in Python.  

## Sources of Exercises  

Most of the exercises included here come from two excellent projects created by my programming teacher:  

- [**PyPaS**](https://pypas.es/docs/) – A collection of Python exercises and problems.  
- [**AprendePython**](https://aprendepython.es/) – A complete learning resource for Python, with explanations, examples, and practice material.  

Both projects are the result of the work of [**@sdelquin**](https://github.com/sdelquin), to whom I give full credit for the material and inspiration.  

## Repository Structure  

The repository is organized as follows:  

- `controlflow/` → Exercises about **conditionals, loops, and program flow control**.  
- `dataestructures/` → Practice with **lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries**, including their operations and applications.  
- `datatypes/` → Exercises covering **basic data types** in Python: numbers, strings, booleans, and conversions between them.  
- `modularity/` → Problems focused on **functions, modules, and code organization** to promote reusability.  
- `text_processing/` → Exercises related to **string manipulation, formatting, and regular expressions**.  
- `data_access/` → Practice with **data persistence in Python**, mainly using **SQLite** for database operations.
